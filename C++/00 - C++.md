## Build-in data types

### Foundamental
* int (integer)
    * (signed | unsigned) short int
    * (signed | unsigned) int
    * (signed | unsigned) long int
    * (signed | unsigned) long long int
* float (floating point):
    * float
    * double
    * long double
* char (character):
    * (signed | unsigned) char
    * wchar_t
    * char16_t
    * char32_t
* bool (boolean)
* void (not allocated)

### Composite
* string
* struct
* class
* template


## Variables



## Functions

* Function prototype: contain the prototype of the function as the type of the value to return, the name and the arguments. It is common practice to store the prototypes inside a "header" file that is invoced by the "#include" directive:
    ```cpp
    type function_name(type param, ...);
    ```

    The input parameters are the variable to pass to the function in order to get a result. Besides it is possible to indicate "optional" parameters, that are not necessary to call. For these parameteres it is necessary to indicate a default value.
    ```cpp
    type function_name(type param_1, ..., type param_n = value);
    ```


## Namespace

```cpp
namespace name
{
	// variables/functions definition
    type variable = value;
	... 
}

int main()
{
    name::variable;
	return 0;
}
```


## Pointers

* Referencing: assign to the pointer, the memory address corresponding of the variable
    ```c++
    type *pointer = &variable
    ```

* Dereferencing: assign to the variable, the value contained in the address at which the pointer is referring
    ```c++
    type variable = *pointer
    ```



## Memory allocation

```cpp
// static allocation (stack)
{
    // variable declaration and assignament
    type variable = value

}

// dynamic allocation (heap)
{
    // pointer creation
    type *pointer_name;

    // pointer allocation
    pointer_name = new type;

    // free allocated memory
    delete pointer_name;

}
```
